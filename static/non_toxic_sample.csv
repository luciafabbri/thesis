t2_118nfp,"Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game (one of the grandfathers of the medium). The company currently running it, Wizards of the Coast, has put quite a bit of effort into making a coherent background story for the sets of cards - previously they did that through weekly short stories on their website and other media, nowerdays they want to mostly do it through e-books.

To sum up: in the world of MTG, there are many ""planes"" - each of them basically a parallel dimension with their own flavour of fantasy. They have a few things in common, most importantly: there are always the five colours of mana and there are very, very rare people that have a ""spark"" that, should it become activated, allows them to travel between those planes. 

Linden is the Queen of Eldraine and reigns together with her husband, Kenrith. The plane is heavily inspired by European folk tales: castles, knights, fairies, witches, basically a big twist on Brother Grimm themes. On Eldraine, the five knightly courts (aligned to the five colours of mana) keep the magical beasts of the Wilds at bay and protect the people of the Realm.

 The story of the set is that a planeswalker called Oko, a chaotic sort-of-anarchist, kidnaps the High King Kenrith, ends up transforming him into a stag and plans to rile up the elves living in the woods against the knightly courts. Kenrith's children, the twins Will and Rowan, try to find and save him.",0.0009050011,0.0001140246,0.0001918203,0.0001292835,0.0001883587,0.0001577437

Abolishment of marriage, prostitution and other gendered structures are legitimate feminist goal and (anarcha+communist+socialist+even some liberal) feminists have long been supporting these goals.

i don't believe i ever did that? i was just saying that the criminalization of sex work under capitalism will only lead to greater exploitation in the industry. also, i do support the abolition of all gendered structures and normative gender roles, i just don't think that outlawing sex work in a capitalist framework is the best way to do that, and would prevent any people who are currently sex workers from exercising the small number of labor rights that workers do have at the moment, such as unionization, legal protection from violence, etc.

t2_6m3iz,"The Kurds have many factions across many countries, but they were under no pretense about American intentions, and likely knew they would pay in blood once again. In Syria, they now negotiate with the Assad government out of mere pragmatic survival. 

In Iraq, Kurdish parties across the spectrum offered their condolences after the Soleimani assassination, because it was his forces, not the Americans, that responded with immediacy after ISIS shockingly took Mosul in 2014 and was bearing down on Erbil:

Within two hours, Suleimani arrived in Erbil with two large airplanes of military supplies, and his personal presence shored up the front-line peshmerga soldiers, so there was a great deal of gratitude for his role in protecting Erbil and Kirkuk from the ISIS onslaught.

From the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq in the immediate aftermath of the assassination:

 ""We are here for the mourning ceremony of a great commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who was a friend of the people of Iraq and a friend of the Kurds in different stages,"" Fazil Mirani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) politburo.

""\[Soleimani\] had a big role in the Iran-Iraq war and he had a very positive role assisting Iraq and Kurdistan in the war against Daesh, 

 ""We send our condolences to his family through the consulate in the name of President Barzani, the KRG \[Kurdistan Regional Government\] presidency, and the KDP Politburo, and the KDP secretariat. We hope that great men in their life serve peace and we hope that losing them will serve the same purpose,"" Mirani added.""

I don't think they much appreciated us taking out the man who was first to helping them avoid genocide, since Shi'a and and other ethnic/religious minorities across the region faced an actual existential threat of genocide at the hands of ISIS (a group with overlapping interests with the Western-aligned axis inside Syria). Especially after we used them and tossed them to the Turks. Whatever the American view on the strike might be.",0.0018261133,0.0001583855,0.0003113045,0.0002469796,0.0002259974,0.0003087293
